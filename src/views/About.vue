        >Tweet-Pin is a project inspired by Twitter and Pinterest. As part of
        the Twitter user collect their favorite media (images, gifs) by hitting
        likes, we found that managing liked tweets is not an easy work. On the
        other hand, Pinterest usually pins the the image and bind the source
        directly to the pinned page, which losses its connectivity to the
        original tweet if one pins a image in one's own timeline.
